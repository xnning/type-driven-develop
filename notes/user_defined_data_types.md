# User Defined Data Types

## Contents

- Defining your own data types
- Understanding different forms of data types
- Writing larger interactive programs in the type-driven style

## Notes

- classify types into five basic groups:
  - Enumerations: types defined by giving the possible values directly
  - Union Types: enumerated types which carry additional data with each value
  - Recursive Types: union types which are defined in terms of themselves
  - Generic Types: types which are parameterised over some other types
  - Dependent Types: types which are parameterised over some other value
